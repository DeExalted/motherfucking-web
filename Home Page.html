<h2><strong>This is a motherfucking badass website.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
And it's fucking perfect. <br>

<h3><strong>Seriously, what the fuck do you want? Ehh bastard, Answer me.</strong></h3>
<p></p>
You probably are fucked in the head to think that you're special. You think getting parallel A's in school means your worthless future is secured.
I laugh in greek ü§£ü§£ü§£,You should have been the main character in the <a href="https://archive.org/details/joker2019hd">joker movie</a>, you worthless piece of junk. You think receiving few hundried 
thousand monthly means life is set? You're a pathetic  fool, and you're no better than those in the gutter. 
Salary job's are  like guns that are placed in your mouth, and you accepting it is like giving the gun a BJ while slowly pulling the trigger, till you're dead.
You're just a deranged  motherfucker to think you'll get to your potential while working under a worthless boss that milks you off your dreams and ambitions.
<h4><strong>What the fuck should I do?</strong></h4> <img src="download.jpeg" alt="download">
<UL>
    <li>Lemon? Make a fucking lemonade or frown from acid STUPID</li>
    <li>Learn a fuckin skill BITCH</li>
    <li>Be Versatile and flexible or crumble you egocentric BUFFALO</li>
    <li>Admit you're a FOOL and know nothing</li>
    <li>Get knowledge at all cost, fill that HOLLOW BRAIN of yours.</li>
</UL>
<br>
<h3><strong>Well guess what, motherfucker;</strong></h3>
<p></p>
All of the struggle does'nt matter in the end. You're still going to be food for the maggots."Skin that glow" that's all you brag about in this miserable life 
of yours, i don't think it makes any difference in the tastebud of those heavenly maggots.
<p></p>
<h3><strong>What counts in the end.</strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li>Your relationship with fellow motherfuckers like you.</li>
    <li>Your mental health, else you become the most fucked motherfucker.</li>
    <li>Your comfort, so life fucks you on a matrass and not on the ground.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3><strong>One more thing...</strong></h3>
